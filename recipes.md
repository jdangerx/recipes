## My Mother's Cooking, a taste of home

Recently, to oblige my children Sushu and John, I was organizing the
various dishes I have made. I was shocked to find that over half were
from my mother. I hope her skill and intelligence can pass down
through the generations.

When I think of my mother's cooking, the first thing that comes to
mind are the smells of the new year. All manner of household dishes
swirl in front of my mind's eye.

First I will discuss the traditional new year's food.

### New Year's dishes

#### 风鸡, Wind Chicken <a name="feng1-ji1">
Origin: Shanghai, from my mother

##### Ingredients
- capon
- salt
- Szechuan peppercorn

##### Procedure
1. About a month before the new year, buy a few capons from the
   market. Do not remove the feathers after butchering.
2. Cut a small opening under the wing and remove the internal organs.
3. Stir-fry some salt and Szechuan peppercorn and put it inside the
   chicken to salt it. Hang it up in a well-ventilated area.
4. Before the new year, retrieve the now dried and salted chicken,
   pull off the feathers, wash it, and steam it. Set aside for the new
   year's feast.
5. To serve as a cold appetizer, tear the meat into strips and plate
   it. It is fragrant, salty, and tender.
